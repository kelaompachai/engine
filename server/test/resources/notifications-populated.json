It's also the latest LTS release for Oracle support customers. Java 8 is not yet EOL so it can still definitely be used.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>OpenJDK Support</em> — No need to be worried about Oracle's recent license changes. With 3.7, Connect now supports both the official <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oracle JDK</a>, as well as OpenJDK distributions like the <a href=\"https://jdk.java.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oracle OpenJDK JDK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azul Zulu</a>, <a href=\"https://adoptopenjdk.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AdoptOpenJDK</a>, and others! So when public security updates cease for Oracle JDK 8, you won't be forced to purchase Oracle support. You can choose whatever Java distribution you want.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Database Connection Pool Options</em> — The database connections Connect uses can now be separated into read/write and read-only pools, which means you can leverage read-replica database scaling for running Connect in a cluster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Advanced Clustering: Guaranteed Message Order</em> — Our <a href=\"https://www.nextgen.com/products-and-services/integration-engine?extension=advanced-clustering\" rel=\"nofollow\">Advanced Clustering extension</a> is great for horizontally scaling your Connect servers, and paired with a load balancer you can greatly improve throughput by allowing channels to run on multiple servers simultaneously. However in some cases you want messages for a particular channel to process <em>in order</em>. This is now possible in 3.7, and can be enabled on a per-channel and per-destination-queue basis!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>User Authorization: Channel Tags / Groups</em> — The role/privilege options for our <a href=\"https://www.nextgen.com/products-and-services/integration-engine?extension=user-authorization\" rel=\"nofollow\">User Authorization extension</a> have been expanded in 3.7! With this you can create more fine-tuned roles. For example you can decide that a particular user should only be able to View/Manage channels that <em>have a certain tag</em>, or that <em>belong to a certain group</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/nextgenhealthcare/connect/wiki/3.7.0---What's-New\"><em>And More!</em></a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/nextgenhealthcare/connect/wiki/3.7.0---What's-New\">See What's New</a>   |   <a href=\"https://github.com/nextgenhealthcare/connect/wiki/Upgrading\">Upgrade Guide</a>   |   <a href=\"https://github.com/nextgenhealthcare/connect/milestone/38?closed=1\">Release Notes</a></p>"

You should upgrade to version 4.4.1 or later.</h2>\n<hr>\n<p>NextGen Connect 3.6.0 includes dozens of new features, improvements, and bug fixes, as well as some new extensions!</p>\n<p>Some key features and benefits of the new release include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>FHIR Connector Extension</em> — In addition to updating our FHIR extension to support STU3 (R3), we've added a number of other enhancements as well! There's a new FHIR Sender destination you can use to connect to external FHIR servers. A new FHIR data type supports both XML and JSON resources simultaneously. A new graphical UI builder for resources is available on the FHIR Sender, as well as on a new transformer step type and code template type. An updated user guide and lots of examples (for instance, how to convert HL7 v2.x to FHIR) are available on the <a href=\"https://github.com/nextgenhealthcare/connect/wiki\">public wiki</a>!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Interoperability Connector Suite</em> — This is a completely new commercial extension that provides Listener and Sender connectors that can help kickstart your eHealth Exchange / Sequoia onboarding and integration. The connectors support the most common operations for PIX, PDQ, XDS.b, XCA, and XCPD. They also support automatic generation and validation of <a href=\"https://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/definition/Nationwide-Health-Information-Network-NHIN\" rel=\"nofollow\">NHIN-compliant</a> SAML/WS-Security sections. In addition, the suite provides a new resource that automatically downloads and syncs business endpoint information from a UDDI Provider!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Multi-Factor Authentication</em> — This commercial extension is new as of 3.5.2, and provides an extra security layer for all user accounts! A secondary device such as a phone, tablet, or landline is used to ensure that no one but the actual user can login, even if they know the correct username and password. Both <a href=\"https://duo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Duo</a> and generic apps such as Google Authenticator / Authy are supported. When using Duo, advanced options such as lockout protection, automatic enrollment, and policy management are available in the Duo administrator dashboard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Advanced Clustering Enhancements</em> — View and manage alerts, server logs, connection logs, and global maps across the entire cluster! Automatically prune old, offline server IDs. Global Scripts now auto-compile across the entire cluster. Reload Resources now executes across the entire cluster. More information on our Advanced Clustering commercial extension <a href=\"https://www.nextgen.com/products-and-services/integration-engine?extension=advanced-clustering\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Amazon S3 support for File Reader/Writer</em> — Both the File Reader and File Writer now support Amazon S3! Set explicit AWS credentials, or use the Default Credential Provider Chain to automatically lookup credentials from a variety of common locations. Temporary credentials are supported as well via the Amazon Security Token Service (STS). You can also supply custom headers for PUT requests, including encryption settings and custom object metadata!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/nextgenhealthcare/connect/wiki/3.6.0---What's-New\"><em>And More!</em></a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/nextgenhealthcare/connect/wiki/3.6.0---What's-New\">See What's New</a>   |   <a href=\"https://github.com/nextgenhealthcare/connect/wiki/Upgrading\">Upgrade Guide</a>   |   <a href=\"https://github.com/nextgenhealthcare/connect/milestone/50?closed=1\">Release Notes</a></p>"
